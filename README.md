# Spring Boot CRUD App
Hello There!<br>
This is a Spring Boot <b>CRUD</b> App (It creates,reads,updates and deletes).<br>
It is based on "Person" Entity, that have "ID" and "Name" as attribute (So, pretty basic)<br>
There is a <b>"Fake DB"</b> that stores data:
```
private static List<Person> DB = new ArrayList<>();
```
Obviously, if you restart the App, all data will be lost.<br>
As you can know, thanks to <b>Dependency Injection</b>, you can easily use a real <b>DataBase</b> instead.

<br> Below you can find some demonstrations as GIFs (Using Postman)
